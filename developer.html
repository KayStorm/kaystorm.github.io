				<strong>First hint of love for computers</strong><br />
				I was first introduced to coding in the MySpace era! I had the flashiest
				page of anyone I knew. I started learning things like how to build my
				own pc by ordering individual parts and assembling them in the shell of
				an HP first loaded with Win95. I made a few simple programs to assist in
				completing redundant school work for high school. And then I stopped
				investing time in the skills because I had been convinced that the only
				way I "qualified" for college was if it was to be a teacher, and I also
				loved the idea of teaching.

				<strong>"Can you come fix this?"</strong><br />
				Many years passed during which I was generally considered the go-to
				friend/co-worker for basic pc troubleshooting. I could usually fix the
				printer in the copy room at school and was generally the first to catch
				on to any new Learning Management System (LMS) the teachers were given.
				I was an early adopter of Google Classroom and taught many teachers the
				power behind Excel. However, when a flashy new program would be
				introduced at a school, I was always passed over while the male teachers
				were assigned the Minecraft in School elective or to given "data pads"
				to integrate with smart projector systems.

				<strong>Pandemic Teaching</strong><br />
				Then, along came Covid-ocolypse. I shifted to online learning without
				issue, but my experience was not the norm. I watched so many of my
				friends, former and current colleagues, and administrators struggle HARD
				with using technology wisely and effectively. Everything seemed so much
				harder than it had to be. I decided to get over my fear of being a woman
				in the Computer Science field and started learning in October of 2021.
				First, via free online tutorials, then through college courses.

				<strong>Second Career</strong><br />
				My first project (beyond Hello, World intro tutorials) was trying to
				make a gradebook in Java. I was practicing with 2D arrays and
				manipulating data and averaging inputs. It was still all entirely
				console/terminal bound. From first look at Java to the point I
				discontinued working on this project was roughly two months. At that
				point, I started to realize that I would need more than just Java and
				started to expand my thinking on my tech career.

				<strong>Web Developer</strong><br />
				I am now currently working as a Junior Web Developer in a part-time
				position with Clear Resolution Consulting. In this role I am managing
				the corporate website, assisting in a potential rebranding of online
				presence, advising on front-end design choices, troubleshooting website
				loading errors, and transitioning the site to an updated platform. This
				opportunity has helped me shift from "learning wide" (covering a lot of
				topics at the beginner level) to "learning deep" (gaining understanding
				of more complicated principles).
