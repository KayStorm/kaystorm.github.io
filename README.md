Kay Davis, Developer and EdTech Professional

This project is the code base for my personal portfolio site. This site will serve as evidence of my skill as a developer, while also reflecting my passion for the education field.

Currently this project is entirely HTML/CSS as I am still in the early stages of production. I also have projects using Java, SQL, JavaScript, and other technologies that I will include.

If you are hiring a Junior Developer, consider this a showcase of what I can accomplish in a short amount of time. I first began working with HTML/CSS in late July and in early September I am able to produce this site. I am a dedicated learner who can skill-up quickly! Let's chat!

PROJECT LOG

10/6 - I launched the site publicly and then dug in to learning the next slew of technologies. Recently, I have been working hard on learning Adobe products to create Instructional Design products. I will be posting my first production with Adobe captivate in the next few days!

9/4 - I am close to launchng this site for public view. At this point I am mainly tidying up what I already have there. I need to load more content into two of the sub pages, but I have gained so much knowledge and skill building this site that every time I work on it I get faster and more efficient.

8/26 - I got stuck on a problem and considered using a template. After loading it on a branch, I reconsidered because part of this project is also about my personal learning and comfort level with web languages and I want the challenge of building from scratch for the first time.

8/24 - I am making small edits each day on the site to practice my coding skills. This is also allowing me to take my time figureing out what I want my final product to look like before I begin using the site openly for job applications and self-promotion.
