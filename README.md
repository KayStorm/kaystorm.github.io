Kay Davis, Developer and EdTech Professional

This project is the code base for my personal portfolio site. This site will serve as evidence of my skill as a developer, while also reflecting my passion for the education field.

Currently this project is entirely HTML/CSS as I am still in the early stages of production. I also have projects using Java, SQL, JavaScript, and other technologies that I will include.

PROJECT LOG
8/26 - I got stuck on a problem and considered using a template. After loading it on a branch, I reconsidered because part of this project is also about my personal learning and comfort level with web languages and I want the challenge of building from scratch for the first time.

8/24 - I am making small edits each day on the site to practice my coding skills. This is also allowing me to take my time figureing out what I want my final product to look like before I begin using the site openly for job applications and self-promotion.
