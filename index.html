			/>
			<p>
				I have gained experience with Java, Python, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and
				JavaScript. In addition to coding, I have experience with a variety of
				supportive technologies such as Drupal, Adobe Creative Cloud, and
				Version Control.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have been an educator for 15 years and a lover of technology since
				childood. I was an early adopter of gamification in the classroom,
				though I was often discouraged or pushed out of the space altogether in
				favor of male counterparts. Even within this environment, I have been
				able to carve out a space in mid-level management at every location I
				have worked.
