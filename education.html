		<p>
			I am a first generation college student. I considered learning to be my
			exit strategy from an unhappy home life. I wanted to "make it out." Once I
			was out, I decided I wanted to help other kids find their ways out, so I
			became a teacher. I graduated from Appalachian State University with a
			degree in Middle Grades Education. My concentrations were in Social
			Studies and English Language Arts.

		<p>
			After 6 years teaching ELA, I decided I wanted to make myself into a
			History specialist and enrolled in grad school at UNCW. I was hopeful this
			would give me deeper knowledge to share with students, and potentially be
			a path to working with older students. I focused my studies on modern
			American History. I completed my thesis research on President Nixon's
			somewhat secret attempts to save the space program, even though many blame
			him for the end of the Apollo program.

		<p>
			I was teaching at the local Adult High School when Covid jarred the world.
			I watched all my teacher friends struggle to transition to a
			digital-dependent world. I decided that I was ready to leave the classroom
			and move into the EdTech field, so I picked up a few classes at the
			community college. It let me test my own skills and interest, and I fell
			in love with the field.

		<p>
			I knew I needed more advanced learning than what CFCC could offer, so I am
			now enrolled in classes at East Carolina University. Within roughly 1.5
			years I will graduate with a Masters Certificate in Computer Based
			Instruction.

			I have taught in 2 public schools, 1 public charter school, and at the
			community college. <br />
			I have tutored students from 3rd grade to college level.<br />
			I spent most of my teaching career in 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. My last
			few years, however, have been at the adult learner level through Adult
			High School and Career Training.<br />
			I have overseen a variety of extracurriculars, including Student
			Newspaper, Student Literary Magazine, and History Bowl. <br />
			I volunteer as a competitive cheerleading coach working with athletes ages
			5-18. I have taken many teams to national level competitions at Disney.
