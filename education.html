			I am a first generation college student. I considered learning to be my
			exit strategy from an unhappy home life. I wanted to "make it out."
		</p>

		<p>
			Once I was out, I decided I wanted to help other kids find their ways out,
			so I became a teacher. I graduated from Appalachian State University with
			a degree in Middle Grades Education. My concentrations were in Social
			Studies and English Language Arts.

			After 6 years teaching ELA, I decided I wanted to make myself into a
			History specialist and enrolled in grad school at UNCW. I was hopeful this
			would give me deeper knowledge to share with students, and potentially be
			a path to working with older students. I focused my studies on modern
			American History. I completed my thesis research on President Nixon's
			somewhat secret attempts to save the space program, even though many blame
			him for the end of the Apollo program.

		<p>
			I was teaching at the local Adult High School when Covid jarred the world.
			I watched all my teacher friends struggle to transition to a
			digital-dependent world. I decided that I was ready to leave the classroom
			and move into the EdTech field, so I picked up a few classes at the
			community college. It let me test my own skills and interest, and I fell
			in love with the field.

		<p>
			I knew I needed more advanced learning than what CFCC could offer, so I am
			now enrolled in classes at East Carolina University. In roughly 1.5 years
			I will graduate with a Masters Certificate in Computer Based Instruction.
